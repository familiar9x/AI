# OCR Cache Directory

This directory stores OCR results to speed up re-ingestion.

## Structure

```
cache/
  ocr/
    {pdf_hash}_p{page}_dpi{dpi}_{lang}.txt
```

## How it works

1. First time OCR a PDF page → generates cache file
2. Next time same PDF → reads from cache (instant)
3. Cache key includes:
   - PDF content hash (SHA1)
   - Page number
   - DPI setting
   - OCR language

## Benefits

- 30-50x faster re-ingest for scanned PDFs
- No need to OCR again if file unchanged
- Survives container restart (volume mounted)

## Management

```bash
# View cache size
du -sh cache/

# Clear cache
rm -rf cache/ocr/*

# Cache is regenerated automatically on next ingest
```

## When cache is invalidated

- PDF file content changes (different hash)
- DPI setting changes in .env
- OCR language changes in .env
- Manual deletion

File renames don't invalidate cache (uses content hash, not filename).
